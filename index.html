								<p style="color:LightGrey;">My Name is Zac Foulds and I am an Australian male trying to persue their dream in the IT field.I completed VCE in 2018 and didn't recieve the atar that I was expecting or after therefore leaving me to start my electrical apprenticeship. I complted my first year of the apprencticeship but I found throughout the year the trade industry wasn't made for me and I have decided to go down another career path. </p>
                <p style="color:LightGrey;">My Interest include watching and playing sports,I happen to play footy, basketball and cricket which keeps me very busy all year round. I have played basketball over in America for 6 weeks where we played a variety of different high schools. I have also played on the MCG during half time of an AFL game a few times and also lucky enough to play at Marvel Stadium doing the same thing. I currently do not have any pets but hoping to get a dog and some more chickens shortly. Another hobby of mine is playing video and computer games with friends from time to time. I work casually as a bartender during the week to earn some spending money. <p>

							<!-- Interest -->
								<article id="Interest">
									<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
									<img class="image main"><img src="ds.jpg" alt=""/></img>
									<p style="color:LightGrey;">My interest in IT started back in primary school when I got my hands on my first DS. I started gaming when I was at a young age and only used and experienced more gaming consoles to the present day. My interest in IT today is very broad, I like video gaming with friends, learning about automation. I have an interest in setting up home networks and running cables as I learnt this during my apprenticeship. I enjoy watching various youtubers talk about technology.<p>
								  <p style="color:LightGrey"> I have an interest in Tesla and Elon Musk and the technology side of car automation and renewable energy. Elon Musk through watching and listening to various podcasts with him in including the Joe Rogan podcast found myself fascinated in renewable energy and automation of vehicles. Besides Musk no one else has really sparked my interest for IT, my cousin was big into gaming so possibly introducing me into that at a young age has helped my passion for IT.</p>
									<p style="color:LightGrey">I chose to do to IT because I have a passion for helping others and want to get a greater understanding and knowledge into IT so I can hopefully one day start my own business and teach the fundamentals and basics that I have learnt to another person to make their life easier with technology.</p>
									<p style="color:LightGrey;">From my studies I expect to learn a vast and variance overview of technology as a whole. I’m doing this course to gain a variety of skills that I can use in the real world. I am doing this course to have my knowledge within the IT field so that once I complete the course I can start my own business.<p>

									<article id="Job">
										<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
										<p style="color:LightGrey;">My dream job is to work as a self employed IT field technician similar to what Geeks2u offer. This job is created to help people have a little understanding or needing assistance with technology and can’t exactly figure tout how to use it themselves. This is when the service of a IT field technician can come to your house or work to resolve and fix the issue. As technology becomes more used around the world the community and users will continue to have trouble understanding how to use it and especially the older generation. This job appeals to me as I am able to offer a service that helps someone else and brings a smile to their face in the process.</p>
										<p style="color:LightGrey;">Skills required for this job would be to have a very broad and well educated knowledge about all things technology including windows, MacBook, iPhone, Android and plenty of other forms of technology. There are no set qualifications for this job but more so the knowledge to be component in completing the job. More life experience and courses will allow you to offer more services that you can help fellow clients with. Other skills that can be useful within this job is knowing how to set up data points, and knowing how to run data throughout a house and install it. This job is attractive to me as I have the power to be my own boss and work when i want, so I can work as much or as little as I need. I am able to find my own work and set times that work for me.</p>
										<p style="color:LightGrey;">Through life and loving technology I have developed knowledge in various different ranges of IT including Mac, IOS, windows and data. I completed my first year of electrical apprenticeship and so I have all the tools and knowledge about running and installing data points and racks. By completing a bachelor of information technology this will further help with my knowledge of IT and help me to complete more difficult task and offer more service. Competing this course will also help me to have more confidence when performing other tasks and allow me to show I have studied and have experience in the field which would hopefully make me stand out compared to others. </p>
										<p style="color:LightGrey;">My plan to obtain these skills is to continue to learn and educate myself, through this bachelor in IT, doing my own research and continue to do small jobs for friends and family where I am able to work and resolve issues in real time to help greater my understanding. Experience can only come with time and putting in the effort to want to know more about the field, learning more and offering more services can only lead to more work as you are not pigeoned holed into only a few small areas. I will continue to find my own jobs to help others as well as study hard during my course so that once I have completed my bachelor of IT, i have the necessary confidence and ability to start working straight away. </p>

											<p style="color:LightGrey;"> These results show am I an extraverted person and like to engage in conversation and express my feelings, I am able to be observant and look and listen to how others are feeling and make my decisions based on how I feel towards the situation. I think this personaility type is accurate as I love to talk and also listen to what others have to say, and majoirty of my decision making is done by feeling and not overly thinking about it. <p>
											<img class="image main"><img src="bfp.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="500"/></img>
											<p style="color:LightGrey;"> The personality test shows I am an extrovert which is agreed upon and I am stable emotionally, very really do I feel stressed or under pressure as I like to plan for things so that I don't have to worry about them or leaving things to the last minute. I show a positive towards agreeableness and can see both sides of the story and learn from what others have to say.<p>
											<img class="image main"><img src="lst.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="500"/></img>
											<p style="color:LightGrey;">A tactile leaner is the learning style that would best describe myself, I learn best when I am doing things hands on. I love to learn by doing and experimenting with things and learning from mistakes made along the way.
											<p style="color:LightGrey;">These results indicate that I am an extravert, that learns from doing tasks hands on. The tests are accurate as I am a talkative and engaging human. The tests indicate I will work well within a group and that I will be assertive with my decision making and also observant of other peoples ideas and suggestions. These results will influence my behaviour positively within my team as I won’t be quiet and have no input my team can rely on me to have idea and also listen and accomodate to what they are trying to say. I can help my team to learn and grow as I will be trying to get everyone engaged rather then being quiet. When forming a team I should consider how other people traits are going to help me learn, I would look for other extraverts who also willing to talk and hold a conversation. Also since I’m a tactile learner would be great to find others who like to work hands on.<p>

												<h3>Automatic Veggie Garden Watering System with Smart Probe Sensor </h3>
												<img class="image main"><img src="vegg.jpg" alt=""/></img>
												<p style="color:LightGrey;">After numerous occasions of knocking on neighbours door the day before heading off on a family holiday the idea of the automatic veggie garden water system will solve all issues. The watering system will stop the need of others watering your garden or even yourself. The smart system only waters when needed as the smart probe sensors in the soil check for when water moisture levels are low and automatically tells the watering system to turn on until moisture levels return to the desired amount and the the system turns the water off. The watering system will solve the issue of your veggies dying after weeks or months of handwork just before harvest. This project is aimed at Veggie Gardens in your house or school as we want to make it as cheap as possible to set up.<p>
												<p style="color:LightGrey;">There is an estimated 9.9 million houses in Australia and 9,400 schools allowing a massive demand for this product. Based off a survey conducted in 2014 which asked Australian households if they grew some sort of food in their backyard. 52% of people agreed to growing fruit. The trend for growing fruit and vegetables is increasing as 2009 24% of households grew fruit and 38% grew vegetables. But in 2014 29% grew fruit and 39% grew vegetables. There is a market need and demand for a product like an automatic watering system as this will save the the gardener time every day watering and also will save water as the exact amount of water will be used and therefor over watering will be stopped. Lastly 40% of people who don’t have veggie gardens stated they don’t have the time needed for one each day, this is where a half a days works is needed to set the system up and then it can be left until harvest but checking every few days to ensure veggies aren’t getting eaten by bugs.<p>
												<p style="color:LightGrey;">For the customer they will only need to supply a tap and a water supply, power and an irrigation system. The automatic watering system will connect between the tap and the irrigation system and act as a barrier to stop the flow of water and the smart probe sensors will go into the soil to test the moisture in the soil. The design for the box will be a square. will a waterproof screen and buttons as inputs to change the days and times of which the water will go through the irrigation system. The box itself will be black in colour and have mounting holes and an IP 66 rating, making this box water proof to and protected to 12.5 mm nozzle at 100LPM at 3 meters away and dust proof. Each corner of the box will have little holes where the purchaser has the option to wall mount the box. Ideally the box is to be off the ground to limit the amount of water around it. The size of the box will be as small as possible to allow to not take up too much space. The box will be made out of hard plastic, to help to deal with damage and make it durable for a long lasting life. The box will be available in either grey, black or white. These colours allow for different scenarios in which what colour fits in to each garden better. The purpose for this system is to allow the gardener to have as little interaction with the watering of his veggie garden as the smart probe sensors do the hard work for them and detect when the garden needs to be watered. Also the gardener has the option to set multiple times throughout the day as you might like your veggie garden to be watered both day and night. The length of time the the irrigation system runs for can be set to the exact time. When setting your preference into each day they time of which they are set too can change day to day and allow for different times on all seven days. The smart probe sensors also detect when to turn off the irrigation system as this will allow for no more over watering of the garden and lead to saving more water.On the face of the box there will be a six buttons, four of which are used to control and change the settings, including up, down, left and right. There will be a central button within the arrows which will be used a the enter button to confirm the changes and preferences set. The last button will be an on and off switch, which will allow for the system to be turned off in periods throughout the year when it’s not being used to save power. Within the display it will show how much water has been used for the day and for the week and weekly rests. this is too ensure you are getting the correct amount of water each time and not too much or not enough. This feature will allow for better water saving. As this automatic water system is just the box with controls this can be used with any irrigation system at your household. Making this product perfect for every home.<p>
												<p style="color:LightGrey;">The software within the system will be need to be made by a manufacturer. The program within the hardware will also be needed to be outsourced to a professional. I have not much knowledge within the software and hardware field in this project, but finding the resources required to build the project will not be too hard as there is not many major components. Creating the structural features such as the box where the hardware and software will be kept can be made by the individual but as we sell the product complete this can be made in a factory which is out sourced to a company that provides this service.<p>
												<p style="color:LightGrey;">Basic tool and gardening knowledge to set up your own irrigation system within your veggie garden. Also having running water and power at the garden so that our smart water system will work. The system will be set up to be easy to use and basically plug and play. All that will be needed to do is to place the smart sensor probes in the desired places into the soil so that they can sense the moisture within the soil. It will be feasible to find the skills required to create my product as it is simple to create as not much is needed for the system to work besides allowing water to pass through and stop according to the sensors.<p>
												<p style="color:LightGrey;">If my projects was to be successful this would solve the issue of time of needing to monitor your veggie garden everyday. This will allow more Australians to grow their own fruit and vegetables at anytime of the year without the hassle of watering them morning and night. This will allow more free time for the gardener to spend doing other activities they enjoy while still getting the goodness of home grown fruit and vegetables. There will be no need to ask your friends or  neighbours to come and water your garden while you're away, you can go away and feel comfortable that you garden is getting the adequate water it needs.<p>
